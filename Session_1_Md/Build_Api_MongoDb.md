# Configure MongoDB

If using Windows, MongoDB is installed at C:\Program Files\MongoDB by default.

 Add C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version_number>\bin to the Path environment variable. This change enables MongoDB access from anywhere on your development machine.


Use the mongo Shell in the following steps to create a database, make collections, and store documents. For more information on mongo Shell commands, see Working with the mongo Shell.


1. Choose a directory on your development machine for storing the data. For example, C:\ReservationData on Windows. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. The mongo Shell doesn't create new directories.

2. Open a command shell. Run the following command to connect to MongoDB on default port 27017. Remember to replace <data_directory_path> with the directory you chose in the previous step.

       mongod --dbpath <data_directory_path>
3. Open another command shell instance. Connect to the default test database by running the following command:

        mongo 
    
4. Run the following in a command shell:

       use ReservationtoreDb
       
    If it doesn't already exist, a database named ReservationtoreDb is created. If the database does exist, its connection is opened for transactions.


5. Create a Reservation collection using following command:

        db.createCollection('Reservation')

The following result is displayed:

        { "ok" : 1 }
6. Define a schema for the Reservation collection and insert two documents using the following command:

console

Copy
db.Reservation.insertMany([{'RoomId':'rmconf1234','Price':1540.93,'Category':'Computers','ReservationName':'Ralph Johnson'}, {'RoomId':'rmking1234','Price':143.15,'Category':'Computers','ReservationName':'Robert C. Martin'}])
7. The following result is displayed:

    {
         "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedIds" : [
          ObjectId("5bfd996f7b8e48dc15ff215d"),
          ObjectId("5bfd996f7b8e48dc15ff215e")
        ]
    }
> Note
>The ID's shown in this article will not match the IDs when you run this sample.

7. View the documents in the database using the following command:

        db.Reservation.find({}).pretty()
        
The following result is displayed:

        {
            "_id" : ObjectId("5bfd996f7b8e48dc15ff215d"),
            "Name" : "Design Patterns",
            "Price" : 54.93,
            "Category" : "Computers",
            "Author" : "Ralph Johnson"
        }
        {
             "_id" : ObjectId("5bfd996f7b8e48dc15ff215e"),
            "Name" : "Clean Code",
             "Price" : 43.15,
            "Category" : "Computers",
             "Author" : "Robert C. Martin"
        }



The schema adds an autogenerated _id property of type ObjectId for each document.

The database is ready. You can start creating the ASP.NET Core web API.

# Create the ASP.NET Core web API project

* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
* Visual Studio for Mac
1. Go to File > New > Project.

2. Select the ASP.NET Core Web Application project type, and select Next.

3. Name the project ReservationApi, and select Create.

4. Select the .NET Core target framework and ASP.NET Core 3.0. Select the API project template, and select Create.

5. Visit the [NuGet Gallery: MongoDB.Driver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver/) to determine the latest stable version of the .NET driver for MongoDB. In the Package Manager Console window, navigate to the project root. Run the following command to install the .NET driver for MongoDB:

PowerShell  |   Copy
------------|------------
Install-Package MongoDB.Driver -Version {VERSION} |
## Add an entity model 
1. Add a Models directory to the project root. |

2. Add a reservation class to the Models directory with the following code:

C#  | Copy
----|-----

    using MongoDB.Bson; 
    using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;

    namespace ReservationApi.Models
    {
    public class reservation
        {
            [BsonId]
            [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)]
            public string Id { get; set; }

            [BsonElement("Name")]
            public string reservationName { get; set; }

            public decimal Price { get; set; }

            public string Category { get; set; }

            public string Author { get; set; }
       }
    }
In the preceding class, the Id property:

* Is required for mapping the Common Language Runtime (CLR) object to the MongoDB collection.

* Is annotated with [BsonId] to designate this property as the document's primary key.

* Is annotated with [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)] to allow passing the parameter as type string instead of an ObjectId structure. Mongo handles the conversion from string to ObjectId.

The reservationName property is annotated with the [BsonElement] attribute. The attribute's value of Name represents the property name in the MongoDB collection.


## Add a configuration model

1. Add the following database configuration values to appsettings.json:

JSON  | Copy
------|----

        {
            "ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings": {
            "ReservationCollectionName": "Reservation",
            "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
            "DatabaseName": "ReservationtoreDb"
        },
            "Logging": {
            "IncludeScopes": false,
            "Debug": {
            "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Warning"
            }
        },
    "Console": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning"
        }
       }
      }
    }
2. Add a ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings.cs file to the Models directory with the following code:


C#   | Copy
------|----



        namespace ReservationApi.Models
           {
             public class ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings : IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings
             {
              public string ReservationCollectionName { get; set; }
              public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
              public string DatabaseName { get; set; }
              }

          public interface IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings
          {
           string ReservationCollectionName { get; set; }
           string ConnectionString { get; set; }
           string DatabaseName { get; set; }
            }
    }
The preceding ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings class is used to store the appsettings.json file's ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings property values. The JSON and C# property names are named identically to ease the mapping process.

3. Add the following highlighted code to Startup.ConfigureServices:

C#   | Copy
------|----

        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
          // requires using Microsoft.Extensions.Options
         services.Configure<ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>(
             Configuration.GetSection(nameof(ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings)));

         services.AddSingleton<IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>(sp =>
             sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>>().Value);

         services.AddControllers();
        }
In the preceding code:

* The configuration instance to which the appsettings.json file's ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings section binds is registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container. For example, a ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings object's ConnectionString property is populated with the ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings:ConnectionString property in appsettings.json.

* The IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings interface is registered in DI with a singleton service lifetime. When injected, the interface instance resolves to a ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings object.
Add the following code to the top of Startup.cs to resolve the ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings and IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings references:

C#   | Copy
------|----

        using ReservationApi.Models;
## Add a CRUD operations service
1. Add a Services directory to the project root.

2. Add a ReservationService class to the Services directory with the following code:

C#   | Copy
------|----

    using ReservationApi.Models;
    using MongoDB.Driver;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;

    namespace ReservationApi.Services
    {
         public class ReservationService
    {
        private readonly IMongoCollection<reservation> _Reservation;

        public ReservationService(IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings settings)
        {
            var client = new MongoClient(settings.ConnectionString);
            var database = client.GetDatabase(settings.DatabaseName);

            _Reservation = database.GetCollection<reservation>(settings.ReservationCollectionName);
        }

        public List<reservation> Get() =>
            _Reservation.Find(reservation => true).ToList();

        public reservation Get(string id) =>
            _Reservation.Find<reservation>(reservation => reservation.Id == id).FirstOrDefault();

        public reservation Create(reservation reservation)
        {
            _Reservation.InsertOne(reservation);
            return reservation;
        }

        public void Update(string id, reservation reservationIn) =>
            _Reservation.ReplaceOne(reservation => reservation.Id == id, reservationIn);

        public void Remove(reservation reservationIn) =>
            _Reservation.DeleteOne(reservation => reservation.Id == reservationIn.Id);

        public void Remove(string id) => 
            _Reservation.DeleteOne(reservation => reservation.Id == id);
        }
    }

In the preceding code, an IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings instance is retrieved from DI via constructor injection. This technique provides access to the appsettings.json configuration values that were added in the Add a configuration model section.

Add the following highlighted code to Startup.ConfigureServices:

C#   | Copy
------|----
    
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.Configure<ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>(
        Configuration.GetSection(nameof(ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings)));

        services.AddSingleton<IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>(sp =>
        sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<ReservationtoreDatabaseSettings>>().Value);

        services.AddSingleton<ReservationService>();

        services.AddControllers();
    }

In the preceding code, the ReservationService class is registered with DI to support constructor injection in consuming classes. The singleton service lifetime is most appropriate because ReservationService takes a direct dependency on MongoClient. Per the official Mongo Client reuse guidelines, MongoClient should be registered in DI with a singleton service lifetime.

Add the following code to the top of Startup.cs to resolve the ReservationService reference:

C#

Copy
using ReservationApi.Services;
The ReservationService class uses the following MongoDB.Driver members to perform CRUD operations against the database:

MongoClient – Reads the server instance for performing database operations. The constructor of this class is provided the MongoDB connection string:

C#

Copy
public ReservationService(IReservationtoreDatabaseSettings settings)
{
    var client = new MongoClient(settings.ConnectionString);
    var database = client.GetDatabase(settings.DatabaseName);

    _Reservation = database.GetCollection<reservation>(settings.ReservationCollectionName);
}
IMongoDatabase – Represents the Mongo database for performing operations. This tutorial uses the generic GetCollection<TDocument>(collection) method on the interface to gain access to data in a specific collection. Perform CRUD operations against the collection after this method is called. In the GetCollection<TDocument>(collection) method call:

collection represents the collection name.
TDocument represents the CLR object type stored in the collection.
GetCollection<TDocument>(collection) returns a MongoCollection object representing the collection. In this tutorial, the following methods are invoked on the collection:

DeleteOne – Deletes a single document matching the provided search criteria.
Find<TDocument> – Returns all documents in the collection matching the provided search criteria.
InsertOne – Inserts the provided object as a new document in the collection.
ReplaceOne – Replaces the single document matching the provided search criteria with the provided object.
Add a controller
Add a ReservationController class to the Controllers directory with the following code:

C#

Copy
using ReservationApi.Models;
using ReservationApi.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ReservationApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ReservationController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ReservationService _ReservationService;

        public ReservationController(ReservationService ReservationService)
        {
            _ReservationService = ReservationService;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<List<reservation>> Get() =>
            _ReservationService.Get();

        [HttpGet("{id:length(24)}", Name = "Getreservation")]
        public ActionResult<reservation> Get(string id)
        {
            var reservation = _ReservationService.Get(id);

            if (reservation == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            return reservation;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult<reservation> Create(reservation reservation)
        {
            _ReservationService.Create(reservation);

            return CreatedAtRoute("Getreservation", new { id = reservation.Id.ToString() }, reservation);
        }

        [HttpPut("{id:length(24)}")]
        public IActionResult Update(string id, reservation reservationIn)
        {
            var reservation = _ReservationService.Get(id);

            if (reservation == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            _ReservationService.Update(id, reservationIn);

            return NoContent();
        }

        [HttpDelete("{id:length(24)}")]
        public IActionResult Delete(string id)
        {
            var reservation = _ReservationService.Get(id);

            if (reservation == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            _ReservationService.Remove(reservation.Id);

            return NoContent();
        }
    }
}
The preceding web API controller:

Uses the ReservationService class to perform CRUD operations.
Contains action methods to support GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP requests.
Calls CreatedAtRoute in the Create action method to return an HTTP 201 response. Status code 201 is the standard response for an HTTP POST method that creates a new resource on the server. CreatedAtRoute also adds a Location header to the response. The Location header specifies the URI of the newly created reservation.
Test the web API
